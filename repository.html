                            <b>Task</b>: The AI system processes loan applications and generates approval recommendations. The recommendation is reviewed by one or more credit officers. The number of human reviewers depends on the size of the loan request, small loans may be reviewed by a single officer, while larger applications require the approval of multiple officers. These officers retain total authority to accept or reject the system recommended application result.
                            <br> <br>
                            <b>Intent</b>: The main intent behind the AI is to support credit officers and increase efficiency in the lending process.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Risks</b>: There are potential fairness risks if the system embeds bias from historic data. Transparency on how recommendations are generated is critical. Over reliance on the systems output could reduce critical evaluation by officers, especially for borderline applications.

                                <i>Output</i>: One or more credit officers review the AI's recommendation. The loan will ultimately be approved or denied, depending on the agreement of the credit officers with the AI recommendation.

                            <i>Process</i>: If the claim is unconfident, then it will be sent to a claim management system which valides the input data. If the claim is confident (in this case, if it fits a known pattern in historic data), then the AI system processes it and outputs a claim report. If the report recommends denying the claim with low confidence, then it will be sent to the claims management system for review.  <br>
                            <i>Output</i>: If the AI generated report recommended denying the claim with high confidence, then the claim is automatically denied. Otherwise, a claims analyst reviews the claims passed through the claims management system and decides whether to approve each claim.

                        <br> <br>
                        <b>Intent</b>:  The AI system is intended to support in the accurate measurement of a patient’s biomarkers by flagging to the carer when a measurement needs to be retaken. Then, the risk score output is supposed to support the carer in determining the next course of action for the patient.                <br><br>
                        <b>Risks</b>: A risk of the system is that the carer or nurse is not confident in its readings or in their ability to use the devices for biomarker measurements. Another risk is that the medical device has internal bias towards certain groups. Data safety is also a risk is the carer decides that emergency services need to be called then the data sharing must follow regulation and protocol.               <br><br>

                        <b>Task</b>: This AI system helps customers determine optimal configurations for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines by conducting multi-objective hyperparameter optimization. The system evaluates trade-offs between safety (minimizing hallucinations), alignment (helpfulness), cost, carbon and latency to identify the best combinations of parameters. The system provides users with a Pareto-optimal frontier of configurations, allowing them to select the configuration that best suits their specific requirements and constraints. 
                        <br> <br>
                        <b>Intent</b>: This AI system ideally enables organizations to deploy more efficient and effective RAG solutions by reducing costs and latency through identifying more efficient configurations while simultaneously improving safety by minimizing hallucination risks in generated responses. It intends to enhance alignment to ensure responses are helpful and relevant to user needs and offers quantifiable benchmarks that can be used for regulatory compliance considerations. The AI system aims to allow for informed decision-making based on multiple competing objectives, helping organizations balance performance with resource constraints.

                            <i>Process</i>: The AI system runs an optimization process that tests various configurations, evaluating each one on five metrics: safety (how factual the responses are), alignment (how helpful the responses are), cost (expense per million queries), carbon (CO2 emissions) and latency (response time). The system produces a visualization showing the trade-offs between different configurations to the user.   <br>
                            <i>Output</i>: Users can examine the results from the AI system and select the configuration that best balances their priorities, enabling informed decision-making without requiring technical expertise in RAG system configuration. If they are not satisfied with the configurations presented, they can modify their input and start the optimization process again.

These agents can have different roles (e.g., coordinator or expert of a certain ontology). Given the data and the task required of them, they build up the knowledge graph draft with nodes and connections. The agent(s) output this knowledge graph draft which is ready to be published on the DKG and connected with other knowledge there.  <br>
                            <i>Output</i>: A review gateway can be implemented where human or agent can approve or adjust the knowledge graph draft before it is published to the DKG.

If published publicly, it can be discovered and used by humans or agents through the DKG.

                            <i>Output</i>: The AI outputs the image with people blurred and it is then used as a image of a public space for a public servant to use for other tasks. If the public servant notices that the AI system did not blur out one or more people, then they can flag that issue and the AI system will be given more data and retrained at a later stage.
